Greater Faydark is one of the largest and most confusing regions in all of the world of Norrath. It is quite large, and also has the added bonus of being dark at all times with few landmarks to tell where you are at any given time. It is the home of the wood elves, and is also the newbie area for the wood elves, high elves, and half elves that start out in Kelethin and Felwithe. It is also very near the homes of both the dwarves and the gnomes, so many members of those races are seen here as well.

Although Greater Faydark is a large zone, there are not too many areas of interest. Most of what can happen here is that one can get lost, so it's best to simply stick to the paths and not wander too far unless you know where you are going or have a good direction sense. The only area of note not on a path is Crushbone, and it is so close to Kelethin that you don't need to wander.
